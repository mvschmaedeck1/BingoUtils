# BingoUtils
This app is a bingo sorter. You can create games specifying questions and answers, and this software will sort them (like bingo). It was created under the idea that the teacher was going to sort the quesions and the students who had the answer on their cards shoud mark them. The first one to mark all answers on the card wins (just like bingo).

### Two syncronized windows

The app is mainly composed by two windows. So when there's a projector plugged in you can let the answers window at the main screen and the questions window at the projector screen.

### Multiple tabs

The app supports multiple tabs, so you can do more than one thing at the time. You can even play more than one game at a time. The tabs are syncronized between windows.

### Multiple languages

For now, the app supports two languages: Portuguese (BR) and English (US). The app is not currently all translated, but I'm working on it.

### Create games (not yet translated)

You can create new games, specifying the matter and subject, and as many questions and answers as you want. You can also save these games in a default folder (at the Doccuments folder). The games are exported in CSV format.
